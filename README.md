# wats1030-static-website
An assignment repository that provides a simple static website students can deploy using a static file server.

In this project we will add the Apache server to our Droplet and point a subdomain to our hosted app. We will host a static website for the game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), which can be played in any HTML5 capable web browser (both desktop and mobile). The point here is not to recreate the game or to code any new elements of the site. We are simply deploying this site at a location of our choosing.

## Basic Requirements

* Set up Apache on your Droplet.
* Clone this repository to a location you can make accessible via Apache.
* Configure Apache to serve this site.

## Stretch Requirements

* Do the exact same thing as above, but using nginx. You can even configure an additional subdomain so that you have the Apache and nginx versions running side by side.
* Deploy another (or two or three more!) apps on your Droplet. (Here is a [list of open source HTML5 games](https://github.com/leereilly/games) you can install.)
* Create an HTML page serving as a homepage for your arcade and host it on your Droplet at a unique subdomain.
